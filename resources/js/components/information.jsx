        This is a simple React application that demonstrates how to use React
        with Laravel. This application consists of two pages: Home and
        Information. The Home page contains a Google Maps embed, while the
        Information page contains information about the application.
      </p>
      <p>
        The application uses React Router to handle routing. The application
        also uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The application is built using
        Laravel Mix, which compiles the assets and generates the final
        JavaScript and CSS files.
      </p>
      <p>
        The application is built using Laravel and React. Laravel is a PHP
        framework that provides a robust set of tools and an application
        architecture that incorporates many of the best features of frameworks
        like Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET MVC, and Sinatra. React is a JavaScript
        library for building user interfaces.
